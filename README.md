# WSCLIENT

This project is a fork of easywsclient which is a simple websockets compatible client

The purpose of this fork is to add support for a server mode as well.

To build for windows you first need CMAKE installed on your machine.

Then run 'build_win64.bat' or 'generate_projects.bat' to create the Visual Studio Solution and project files

To build for Linux you need CMAKE installed on your machine.

Then run 'build_linux64.sh' or 'generate_projects.sh'

When you run ./TestClient pass the name of the server you are trying to connect to: i.e. "localhost"
